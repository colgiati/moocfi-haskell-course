# moocfi-haskell-course
So far, I have only done part 1 of the Haskell course. The full course contains two parts. The course can be found [here](https://haskell.mooc.fi/), the exercises without solutions [here](https://github.com/moocfi/haskell-mooc).

Disclaimer: The solutions might not be perfect.
